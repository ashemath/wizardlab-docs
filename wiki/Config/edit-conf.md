# Configuring Sphinx

## Editing conf.py
 
The conf.py file that you need to edit lives under `build/docs/conf.py`

### Project Information
[sphinx-doc/usage/configuration/project-information](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/configuration.html#project-information)

```python
 # -- Project information ----------------------------------------------
 html_title = 'Wizardlab Docs'
 project = 'wizardlab-docs'
 copyright = '2023, The Wizard'
 author = 'Wizard Lab'
 release = '2023'
```
Edit the strings as needed. These settings will effect the `footer` and the 
Title of your documentation pages.
